    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      My name is Sandy Chen, and I am a current undergraduate senior at
      Arizona State University, pursuing concurrent degrees in Computer Information
      Systems and Management. Originally from Yuma, Arizona, I have been able to involve
      myself in many different experiences, whether they be professional, academic, or personal.

      I am committed, driven, and determined to persevere through every situation that I come across,
      and will not stop until the completion of that goal.
